# Lab 4: Blog!

*A React+Redux Conent Platform!*

[deployed url](giakim-cs52-platformclient.surge.sh)

## What Worked Well
I really enjoyed styling the whole blog and using material-ui! I also made sure to use my states and props in a clean way since I struggled a little bit with that for lab 3. 

## What Didn't
I'm not sure why but when editing a post, you have to make sure your cursor is at the beginning of the text.

## EC
Input validation â€” check that all fields have required values when creating new form for instance.
It also displays an error message if the all of the components are not filled.
I worked really hard on the styling of the blog. (Each page has its own title "typewriter"-ish animation, the background is animated, etc!:) )
